This workshop is based on the Microsoft tutorials for learning to train a model in Azure Machine Learning Studio.

This workshop contains three distinct tasks that will help you with understanding the moving parts when:
1) [**Training a model**](https://github.com/OrdinaRoelant/MLStudioWorkshop/blob/master/Training%20a%20model/workshop.md)
2) [Deploying a model](https://github.com/OrdinaRoelant/MLStudioWorkshop/blob/master/Deploying%20a%20model/workshop.md)
3) [Running automated machine learning experiments](https://github.com/OrdinaRoelant/MLStudioWorkshop/blob/master/Running%20auto%20ML%20experiments/workshop.md)

For participating in this workshop you need an Azure subscription with credits to setup the ML studio and compute resources. If you do not have an Azure subscription, we can provide you with an Azure Pass which you can use to setup a fresh user account.  

## Applying for an Azure pass ##

When checking in on [The Global AI check-in](https://checkin.globalai.community), please use your personal name and e-mail to register for an Azure Pass. You will receive an e-mail with further instructions on how to claim your Azure Pass. Please check you spam folder if you do not receive the e-mail promptly, although it can take a few minutes.  

Use **GAIUT22** as the event code when you are prompted to enter it during the application.

When claiming the pass and setting up your Azure account, please use a new Outlook account to avoid subscription de-activation for certain e-mail domains. Using the outlook account will prevent this.  

**NOTE:** Please only claim one Azure pass since the number of available Azure passes is limited for our event.
