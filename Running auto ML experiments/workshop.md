This workshop is based on the Microsoft tutorials for learning to train a model in Azure Machine Learning Studio.

This workshop contains four distinct tasks that will help you with understanding the moving parts when:
1) [Training a model](https://github.com/OrdinaRoelant/MLStudioWorkshop/blob/master/Training%20a%20model/workshop.md)
2) [Deploying a model](https://github.com/OrdinaRoelant/MLStudioWorkshop/blob/master/Deploying%20a%20model/workshop.md)
3) [**Running automated machine learning experiments**](https://github.com/OrdinaRoelant/MLStudioWorkshop/blob/master/Running%20auto%20ML%20experiments/workshop.md)

In this part we are going to run automated machine learning experiments by:
