This workshop is based on the Microsoft tutorials for learning to train a model in Azure Machine Learning Studio.

This workshop contains four distinct tasks that will help you with understanding the moving parts when:
1) [**Training a model**](https://github.com/OrdinaRoelant/MLStudioWorkshop/blob/master/Training%20a%20model/workshop.md)
2) [Deploying a model](https://github.com/OrdinaRoelant/MLStudioWorkshop/blob/master/Deploying%20a%20model/workshop.md)
3) [Versioning a model](https://github.com/OrdinaRoelant/MLStudioWorkshop/blob/master/Versioning%20a%20model/workshop.md)
4) [Running automated machine learning experiments](https://github.com/OrdinaRoelant/MLStudioWorkshop/blob/master/Running%20auto%20ML%20experiments/workshop.md)

In this part we are going to train a model from scratch by:

✔ [Creating a pipeline](#create-a-new-pipeline)  
✔ [Importing your data](#importing-your-data)  
✔ [Prepare the data for training](#prepare-the-data-for-training)  
✔ [Training the actual model](#training-the-actual-model)  
✔ [Evaluating the model](#evaluating-the-model)  

### Create a new pipeline

### Importing your data 

### Prepare the data for training  

### Training the actual model

### Evaluating the model
