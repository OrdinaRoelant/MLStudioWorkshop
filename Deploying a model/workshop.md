This workshop is based on the Microsoft tutorials for learning to deploy a model in Azure Machine Learning Studio.

This workshop contains four distinct tasks that will help you with understanding the moving parts when:
1) [Training a model](https://github.com/OrdinaRoelant/MLStudioWorkshop/blob/master/Training%20a%20model/workshop.md)
2) [**Deploying a model**](https://github.com/OrdinaRoelant/MLStudioWorkshop/blob/master/Deploying%20a%20model/workshop.md)
3) [Versioning a model](https://github.com/OrdinaRoelant/MLStudioWorkshop/blob/master/Versioning%20a%20model/workshop.md)
4) [Running automated machine learning experiments](https://github.com/OrdinaRoelant/MLStudioWorkshop/blob/master/Running%20auto%20ML%20experiments/workshop.md)

In this part we are going to deploy a model by:

✔ Create a real-time inference pipeline  
✔ Create an inferencing cluster  
✔ Deploy the real-time endpoint  
✔ Test the real-time endpoint  

## Training a model
In this part of the workshop we are going to deploy the model we trained in [part 1](https://github.com/OrdinaRoelant/MLStudioWorkshop/blob/master/Training%20a%20model/workshop.md). Be sure to finish that part first, before continuing with the deployment part.

## Create a real-time inference pipeline  
To deploy your pipeline, you must first convert the training pipeline into a real-time inference pipeline. This process removes training components and adds web service inputs and outputs to handle requests.

1) Above the pipeline canvas, select **Create inference pipeline** > **Real-time inference pipeline**.

## Create an inferencing cluster  

## Deploy the real-time endpoint  

## Test the real-time endpoint
